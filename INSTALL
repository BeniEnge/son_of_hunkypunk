To install Hunky Punk on an Android device, your best bet is to go
to Google's application Market and grab a precompiled binary there.

Failing that, if you want to compile it yourself, you need to import it 
in Eclipse project and make proper links to Android NDK.

I'm not sure how to give precise instructions for the former, but the latter
is accomplished by issuing the following commands in NDK root dir:

cd apps
ln -s $HUNKYPUNKDIR andglk
cd ..
cd sources
ln -s ../apps/andglk/jni/* .
cd ..

After that, issuing make APP=andglk should compile native code.

Depending on your distro you might have issues with inform.y in nitfol code;
I've found that sometimes I needed to use bison manually to generate the parser. YMMV.

Developed and tested with Android SDK version 1.6-r1 and NDK version 1.5-r1.
