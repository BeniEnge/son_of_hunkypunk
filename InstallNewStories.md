# How to install new story files #

To add new interactive fiction stories to your library, download them from http://ifdb.tads.org/.  Once downloaded, use a File Manager app to tap the story file from your download folder.

The following file extensions are recognized by Son of Hunky Punk:

  * **`*`.z1-z8,`*`.dat,`*`.zcode** = "Standard" Z-code files
  * **`*`.zblb,`*`.zblorb** = Blorbed Z-code files
  * **`*`.gam,`*`.t2,`*`.t3** = Tads game files

Currently Son of Hunky Punk does not support compressed archives such as zip, 7z, gz, etc.  Many good file manager apps (Es File Explorer for example) can be used to extract the story files on your Android device.

Some downloaded games are able to be installed by tapping the completed "Download Notification" in the Android browser.  For this to work properly the internet source needs to set the content type as a zcode or tads game (specifically the mime-type must be application/x-zmachine or application/x-tads).  Even from links on ifdb, this is not consistent.  Therefore, it is recommended to use the File Manager method above.
