This is Hunky Punk, an interactive fiction interpreter for Android.

== Overview ==
Hunky Punk is an interactive fiction manager and interpreter,
aimed to be a comprehensive multi-interpreter similar to Gargoyle,
with metadata and story management support. Currently Z-Code
stories are supported (via nitfol) and metadata and covers are
fetched from IFDb.

For quick start there is a handful of (subjectively selected 
by your humble author) stories available for download at a single button touch.

You should also be able to open Z-Code stories directly from the web
(as long as the web server reports the correct mimetype) and have them
installed; failing that, putting a story in Interactive Fiction directory
of the SD card also makes it available in Hunky Punk.

Saved games are stored per-game in the phone memory, so you can have
same names in different games without the risk of name clash.

Hunky Punk does its best to save current state and restore it on
application suspend/resume and it works rather well, although occasionally
it will fail due to interpreters not really having been designed for such thing.
So remember to save your progress from time to time. 

== Code overview ==
It's based on Glk-based interpreters (as of 2009-10-27, only nitfol)
and a Glk library dedicated for Android, wrapping Android calls with 
JNI for C-to-Java interface.

== Thanks ==
Most of the inspiration for visual form comes from Gargoyle [1]
and many thanks go to Tor Andersson and Ben Cressey.

I'm also grateful to Mike Roberts of IFDb [2] and TADS fame, for
creating IFDb in the first place and for letting me use the 
alpha version of its web API.

Interpreter and babel/glk interface code may be copyright and licenced by their respective
authors as specified in their source files. I (RR) have done some trivial modifications,
so you might want to check before going to the original authors with bugreports.

In particular, nitfol code is copyright (C) 1999 Evin Robertson and licenced with GPL2+.
The particular codebase is taken from Gargoyle and I understand there are some
modifications by Gargoyle authors.
